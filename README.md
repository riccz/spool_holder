# Filament Spool Holder #

This is a 3d-printing filament spool holder inspired by the [Quick Change
Universal Spool Holder by
Foreverwinter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241566).  It is designed
around the spool holder included in the [Geeetech Prusa I3 Pro
B](http://www.geeetech.com/wiki/index.php/Acrylic_Prusa_I3_pro_B) printer, but
can be easily adjusted to fit onto any horizontal support rod.
