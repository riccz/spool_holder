# Spool Holder #

This is a parametric holder for 3D-printing filament spools adapted from the
[Quick Change Universal Spool Holder by
Foreverwinter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241566).

The default parameters are tuned to integrate with the acrylic spool holder
included in the Geeetech Prusa I3 Pro B.

The default parameters should fit a wide variety of filament spools.

By default the threaded sleeve fits on a rotating 20mm rod/tube.
